[TimyNote](https://timynote.word-x.com/) is a note software that supports Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, Mac system and any other systems with browser installed.

## Why do we create TimyNote?
Once we used Wordpress as our local note-taking tool, but when our notes exceeded 2,000, it became heavy and slow, especially when we have some big software running and the CPU usage was very high. Then, we tried some other software like CherryTree, Joplin, Obsidian, etc. Although these products are very excellent, they have too much features that slow down their speed and use too much resources.

What we really want is a light-weight and super fast note software based on browser that supports any operation system. Because everyone has a browser installed on their PC, and we open and use browser almost every day. We don't need to open a new software window if we can write note in a browser tab.

## Philosophy
 - Think before write: simplify the contents mainly in brain, and use TimyNote to keep it.
 - Minimalism: only  write important content
 - Simple and fast: when we want to write something, it should start very fast, even the CPU usage is high  
cross-platform: support any devices including PC and mobile devices
 - Protect your privacy: no central cloud and you can fully controll your data
 - Templates: remove repetitive typing and insert template with one click
 - Mainly text: support image and table, but mainly text. Too many images will be large and difficult to manage.

## Target users
- Try to find a multi-platform note app that supports Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS and other OS with browser installed.
- Users who enjoy jotting down work notes, personal diaries, or ideas.
- Users who dislike complexity and embrace minimalism.
